# Netflix-comedy-specials
Exploratory text analysis project for Ranker.com's top ten Netflix comedy special.

This jupyter notebook contains some exploratory data analysis on transcripts scraped from https://scrapsfromtheloft.com
using BeautifulSoup. It also uses Python's Pickle package, which allows for the conversion an object in memory to a byte stream that can be stored on disk. Later on, this character stream can then be retrieved and converted back into a python object -- i.e. "pickling"

Transcripts were chosen based on [Ranker.com's "The Best Netflix Stand Up Comedy Specials" list] (https://www.ranker.com/list/best-netflix-original-stand-up-comedy-movies/ranker-streaming?page=3).
